Hi, my name is Jai Relan, I'm 15-year-old and I like to do crazy things! 

I recently started a company called WhyQ. We're a WhatsApp based chatbot providing the infrastructure for social distancing in residential colonies in India. I also [spoke about my journey at TEDxYouth@Baner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIsS1FnBuUo)

We work on ensuring the safety of the visit of the customer in 3 ways:
1. Helping people find the best time slot to come to the local Kirana store.
2. Ensuring that the order is ready before the customer even steps foot outside their house reducing the waiting time from 11 minutes to 20 seconds. 
3. Doing digitised inventory management and providing a Customer Management Tool all through WhatsApp. 

I've also had previous experience working in entrepreneurship, product design, data analysis and design thinking. In the past few years, I've worked with companies from all over the world, from Delhi to Palo Alto. 

I like to code, make cool shit and change the world. 

Feel free to reach out or check some of my work. 

Cheers,
Jai Relan
